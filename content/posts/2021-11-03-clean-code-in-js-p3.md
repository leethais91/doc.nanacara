How can we have write a good function/method? This is the list of the features that a function must have to be considered "good":

- Small
- Do one thing
- Have no side effects
- One level of abstraction
- Use descriptive names
- Low number of arguments
- Command Query Separation
- Prefer exception to error Codes
- "Don't repeat yourself"


## Small
> “The first rule of functions is that they should be small. The second rule of functions is that they should be smaller than that.” — Robert C. Martin
